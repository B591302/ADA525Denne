When we received this assignment, I thought about creating something practical that I would personally use. I decided to design a portable laptop stand for myself. To gather some inspiration and ideas for its design, I began searching the internet. I came across a laptop stand available for purchase online, which I used as a reference for how I would like my stand to look.

Originally, my plan was to make a laptop stand that closely mirrored the one I had seen online. But after a conversation with Frikk, we contemplated the idea of creating a stand without the large top plate. Making it therfore different from the inspiration. My first sketch looked like this. I knew I would have to include a bottom part, a single piece to increase the height, and something to hold the laptop in place.

This photo displays my first prototype. I recognized the need for a way to secure the angle, but I was unsure about how I wanted to accomplish that, which is why I didn't initially include it in the sketch.


My initial sketch was created using Fusion 360. I divided it into four distinct parts: the bottom section, the height adjustment component, a cylinder for connecting these parts, and a support beam to maintain the distance between the two sections.

After printing and assembling all the components, I realized my first mistake. The location where the laptop needed to sit was too close to the bottom part, making it impossible for the laptop to rest on it. I recognized the need to modify that specific area.

To enable the stand to stand on its own, I knew I had to create a new supporting component. I opted to design a piece resembling a "Y" shape that could provide the necessary support. I drafted this new part in Fusion 360 and then proceeded to 3D print it.

I attached it to the stand and noticed that it would work as I had intended. However, as I had previously observed, the length of the height adjustment part was too short. Therefore, I needed to make one more change by extending that part in order to complete my product.

I proceeded to lengthen it in Fusion 360.

I didn't make any changes to the parameters in the slicer; I stuck with the default settings.

I'm quite satisfied with the end result. It's a departure from the original stand, but it functions well. My only concern is that it might be a bit too short. It's challenging to make it longer when the 3D printer has a maximum length of 258 mm, and I'm currently using 230 mm.
