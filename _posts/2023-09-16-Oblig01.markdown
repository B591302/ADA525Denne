My project involves creating a drivable robot that uses a camera to detect and follow a face. For this, I will need the following components: 4 wheels, 2 motors, a webcam, some form of computer (such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi), and a power source (battery). The CAD prototype drawings below illustrate the concept of how I would like to build it:

The robot will have 4 wheels attached to the base, with 2 motors located on the front tires. In the center, there will be the computer and battery source, and I'll also incorporate a stand to elevate the camera
The robot will use it's camere to look for faces. I will be using a premade facial recegnition algoritme from "Open CV" when the robot spots a face it will adjust itself to make the face to be in the middel of the camere. It will do it by using the 2 motors, applying more power to one of the motors to turn in the right direaction. When a face is cenraled it will give equal power to both motors and drive straight. Adjusting along the way if the face would move.

I will not need any external components. Instead, I would like to 3D-print the components I need to assemble my robot.

I will use 3D printing to create most of the robot, including the wheels, camera stand, and the base. Additionally, after some introductory experience with laser cutting, I may consider using it to make the box for housing the computer and batteries. I will make that decision at a later time.

The mechanical movement will be controlled by the 2 motors. Depending on the desired direction, each motor will receive different power levels. For example, when moving straight, both motors will receive equal power. When turning left, the right motor will receive more power, and when turning right, the left motor will receive more power.
