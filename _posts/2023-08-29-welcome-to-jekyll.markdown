Assignment 00: Filan project outline

My final project will be a small robot that will follow a individuall with the use of facial recognition.

The idea is to make a robot that with a camere shall be able to identify a person face looking at it. When i registares a person it starts to roll toward it with the use of motorized wheels. 

For the facial recognition program i will use pre made system. Where i have been looking into openCV for that purpose. 

The robot will be small, my idea is to make drive using 2 wheels. The camere, arduino Rasberry pie will be inbetween the wheels.

^i like it, picasso

This prototype shows how i picture the robot itself. The motor, arduino, rasberry pie and the camere shows how i plan to connect it. 

What i hope to be able to do in the end is create a web socket that will let me follow my robot with my phone.
