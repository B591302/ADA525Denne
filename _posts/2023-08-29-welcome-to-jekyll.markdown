Assignment 00: Final project outline

My final project will be a small robot that will follow a individuall with the use of facial recognition.

The idea is to make a robot that with a camere shall be able to identify a persons face looking at it. When itregistares a person it starts to roll toward it with the use of motor attached to  wheels. 

For the facial recognition program i will use pre made system. Where i have been looking into openCV for that purpose. 

The idea off how the robot will follow is by using the camere. When the robot establishes a face to follow it will make a measurement or just a vector in that direction. That will be used to calculate how it will get there. The idea is with a use of 2 wheels and motors that he will give equal power to both wheels if he will drive straight, more power to the left motor to turn right and more power to the right motor to drive left.

The robot will be small, my idea is to have 2 wheels. The camere, arduino Rasberry pie will be inbetween the wheels.

This prototype shows how i picture the robot itself and how the motor, arduino, rasberry pie and the camere will be connected.
