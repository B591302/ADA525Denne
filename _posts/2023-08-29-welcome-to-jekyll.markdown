Assignment 00: Filan project outline

My final project will be a small robot that will follow a individuall with the use of facial recognition.

The idea is to make a robot that with a webcam shall be able to identify a person face looking at it. When i registares a person it starts to roll toward it with the use of motorized wheels. 

What i will have to decide is how the robot will be outlined. Shall it have 2 wheels, making it smaller with the benefits and negatives off that, or do i want to make it more like a car with 4 wheels.
