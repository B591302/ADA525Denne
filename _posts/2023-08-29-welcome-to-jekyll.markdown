Assignment 00: Filan project outline

My final project will be a small robot that will follow a individuall with the use of facial recognition.

The idea is to make a robot that with a webcam shall be able to identify a person face looking at it. When i registares a person it starts to roll toward it with the use of motorized wheels. 

For the facial recognition program i will use pre made system. Where i have been looking into openCV for that purpose. 

The robot will be small, my idea is to make drive using 2 wheels. The camere, arduino Rasberry pie will be inbetween the wheels.
