title:  "Assignment 07: web interface server -> client"
---


The assignment this week was to create a web application hosting a web interface. The interface should be capable of retrieving data from the server using HTTP GET requests. The assignment involves sending dummy data every 10 less seconds, which should then be visualized using libraries like Chart.js.


In the process of creating this application, I initially considered the need for three different files. The first file is a Node file responsible for hosting the server. This file should contain information for server hosting and the data that needs to be sent. The second Node file is dedicated to the client side, which is tasked with fetching data from the server and updating the graph accordingly. The last file, index.html, serves as the necessary HTML file to transform it into a web application.

With the Chart.js library, I am able to visualize the data from the server, updating the graph every 5 seconds.


With my solution, I can generate random data and host the server with HTTP GET requests. I then plot the data on the web page using a graph on the client side. This experience has provided me with an understanding of simple GET requests and client-server connections, serving as a starting point for learning how to host information online. For my final project, I plan to host information related to whether the camera detects a face, the camera's location, and the motor changes. The intention behind sharing this data is to aid in troubleshooting my code and improving the accuracy of face detection.
