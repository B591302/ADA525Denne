title:  "Assignment 03: Lazer cut part"
---


This assignment challenges us to craft a box with dimensions not exceeding 100x100x100mm, relying solely on finger joints for assembly without the use of any adhesive. The core concept behind this task is to gain insights into the impact of laser cutter-induced kerf, which is the material removed during cutting. The magnitude of this kerf can vary from 0.08mm to 1mm, contingent on the material being worked with.

I began the project by creating a design for one of the box's sides using Fusion 360. Quickly, I realized that I needed to create three distinct shapes, each of which would be duplicated to assemble the six sides of the box. Initially, I set the dimensions for the box at 55x55x55mm. Our teaching assistant (TA) informed us that the kerf for our laser cutter was 0.025mm. Although I had read on cutlasercut.com that the kerf for 3mm plywood was 0.2mm, I decided to follow our TA's guidance. Consequently, I designed the three sides using the measurements depicted in the image below.

As illustrated in the image below, my working hypothesis was that the kerf would need to be halved since the laser cutter removes material on both sides during the cutting process.

This approach seemed logical, considering that the laser cutter's operation entails material removal from both the left and right sides of the cutting path.

The box was able to stand, but the lazer cut to much of the material off. Making it unable to stick together.

In my subsequent iteration, I decided to make a significant adjustment to my approach by assuming a larger kerf of 0.1mm and still applying the concept of halving it for each side. While creating the box, I mistakenly miscounted the number of joints. Nevertheless, the increased kerf size turned out to be a problem. It was substantial enough to hinder proper assembly, making it challenging to ensure the pieces would stick together securely. However, it was also nearly impossible to see thorugh the joints. This led me to the conclusion that while I was moving in the right direction, my adjustments were still not precise enough to achieve the desired result.

I noticed that I was going closer to the 0.2mm that i had discovered on the cutlasercut.com. I decided to use that. Drew the 3 different sides in fusion.

This time it worked perfectly. The box is strong and steady holding together by using the finger joint.

So my conclusion is that the kerf while using 3mm plywood is 0.2mm same as cutlasercut.com said.

Laser cutting technology offers several advantages for rapid and precise prototyping. When working with two-dimensional designs and employing finger joints, the process becomes notably faster and highly accurate. Additionally, laser cutting provides the flexibility to work with a wide range of materials beyond plastic, which is typically used in 3D printing. This versatility allows for the exploration of different material properties and characteristics, expanding the creative possibilities in the prototyping process

I'm considering utilizing a laser cutter for my final project, with the primary aim of facilitating rapid iterations in the prototype development phase. This approach will enable me to efficiently assess the fit and functionality of various components, ensuring they align with my project objectives. Specifically, I envision employing the laser cutter to craft the robot's base and a protective enclosure for housing essential components like the microcontroller and batteries.

I googled kerf in the start off the assignment to get better uderstandin off it. Therfore I found this page that I used as source:
