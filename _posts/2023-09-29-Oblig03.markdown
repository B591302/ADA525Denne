title:  "Assignment 03: Lazer cut part"
---


This assignment has us making a box, no bigger then 100x100x100mm that needs to stick together by using finger joints and no glue. The idea behind this task is to understand the kerf that accours while using a lazer cutter. Kerf is the material that the lazer burns away while cutting. It ranges from 0.08-1mm depending on the material.

I started by drawing in Fusion one of the sides. I quikcly found out that i needit to make 3 different shapes and print all of them twice to make a 6 side box. My first iteration I made a box size of 55x55x55mm. Our TA told us the kerf was 0.025 mm. I had read on cutlasercut.com that the kerf for 3mm plywood was 0.2mm. But i decided to listen to the TA instead. So i made the 3 sides with the measuerments on the photo beneth.

As shown in the photo beneth my therory was that the kerf would have to be divided by 2 because it cuts on both sides.

The box was able to stand, but the lazer cut to much of the material off. Making it unable to stick together.

So when i did the next iteration i decided to increse my theory off how big the kerf is. I increased it to being 0.1mm, and used the same idea to divided by 2 for each side. I drew the box on auto pilot and made a mistake in the amount of joints. But it did not matter that i made that mistake cause it still was incorrect kerf. To big of an error to be able to make it stick together, but almost to small to see thorugh it. I concluded that i was going in the right direction but it was not good enough.

I noticed that I was going closer to the 0.2mm that i had discovered on the cutlasercut.com. I decided to use that. Drew the 3 different sides in fusion.

This time it worked perfectly. The box is strong and steady holding together by usin the finger joint

So my conclusion is that the kerf while using 3mm plywood is 0.2mm same as cutlasercut.com said.

Lasercut technology is quite beneficial in making prototype fast and precise. If you can make it in 2 dimensional using and using fingerjoints you are able to make your prototype faster. Another benefit is using differnet material. In this class we have learned about 3D printing, but we have only used plastic there. Can use more versitial material with a laser. 

I can potentially use the laser for my final project. What i would like to use it for is rapid iterasjons for the prototype. Testing if the part i am making fits, and works in the way i want it to. I can se for me the base of the robot and the "house" holding the microcontroller, batteries etc can be in protected enviorment by being build over.
